This is my first machine learning project in Python, where I created a predictive algorithm that forecasts the next day's stock prices based on the past week's closing data. Initially focused on next-day predictions, I shifted emphasis to accurately predicting market trends and stock directions before trying to return back to the focus of price forecasting. Throughout this ongoing project, I have honed my programming skills in Python and grown to enjoy learning about machine learning while applying my data analytical skills to real-world datasets. I plan to work on this project more and improve my accuracy metrics as much as possible while learning more ways to make this model more advanced.
